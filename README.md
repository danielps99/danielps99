### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have been a Systems Analyst since 2012. Starting in 2009, I studied and played with several languages such as: Pascal Zim, Batch Script, HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, SQL, Shell Script, PL/SQL, MQL5 and Java. Even though I no longer use these languages, going through these experiences made me able to face the challenge of learning a new language or framework.

I consider myself lucky in my career choice, I really enjoy developing software.

Currently as a fullstack developer, I use Java, Hibernate JPA and JDBC, AngularJs, Angular2+, Junit for unit testing and Selenium WebDriver for automated testing in the browser. I currently don't use it, but I have reasonably fresh memory using Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Web and Java PrimeFaces.

I'm a little introverted, but nothing that hinders communication in a team. Since 2016, I have worked on teams that use, or strive to use, agile methodologies, the classic mix of Scrum and Kanban.

I started working remotely in 2016, I worked in person for 5 months between 2019 and 2020, every other month I worked remotely. I currently want to retire working remotely.

I like studying, currently my areas of interest are: Ethical hacking and DevOps.
